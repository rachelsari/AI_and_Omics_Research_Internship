# Module_I â€“ AI_Omics_Internship_2025

This project is part of the AI_Omics_Internship_2025 training, focusing on learning basic data wrangling in R.

### Tasks Completed:
- Created standardized folder structure (`raw_data`, `clean_data`, `scripts`, `results`, `plots`)
- Imported and inspected `patient_info.csv`
- Corrected data types using `as.factor()` and `ifelse()` functions
- Created a binary variable for smoking status (`1 = Yes`, `0 = No`)
- Saved the cleaned dataset and script

> Learning R from scratch and finally working on real datasets has been a meaningful experience. Proud to take this first step toward becoming a bioinformatician!
